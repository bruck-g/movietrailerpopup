    <h1>Bruck's Trailer</h1>
    <p>This is a short clip, produced by professional director Bruck Gebre. Bruck Gebre has directed for many large movies such as Black Panther, Batman vs. Superman, Harry Potter and much more. However, Bruck wants to quit his job as a professional director to pursue his passion in frontend development. He combined the two, and made this short clip of a video trailer popup, used to prepare the audience before the movie plays. Enjoy! </p>
